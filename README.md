This is an unlocker for Call Of Duty Warzone/Modern Warfare...

How to use:
Once installed, open the file named "MWDLLv2.vcxproj" and go to Source Files, itll be towards the bottom of the Solution Explorer, Find the file named "dllmain.cpp". Delete everything inside and replace with code from thread (It should be updated regularly)
Threadmaker sidhu69 says they would keep the code posted and updated as soon as they could (Can check this by looking at the bottom when it says Lasted edited, and the reason)
Go to the top. Click the "Build" tab, then "Batch Build...", check the box for solution Config "Release|x64" then click build.
Once done. check to make sure it reads 
Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped 
at the end of the log, go to the folder with the src, open folder x64, then Release, find file "MWDLLv2.dll", copy it and paste it in the folder titled "unlocker+injecter" and replace the default dll. 
Run "run.bat" 
Launch game, 
wait for the animation/start up movie
hit anykey, wait for CMD prompt to open, and then go into the game you launched, and that should be good 

(Ive noticed attachments arent unlocked, but you can use blueprints, all ops, some camos, all stickers, all dangles, ect ect...)
